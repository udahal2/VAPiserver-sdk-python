    This expression describes how long the bot will wait to start speaking based on the likelihood that the user has reached an endpoint.
    
    This is a millisecond valued function. It maps probabilities (real numbers on [0,1]) to seconds that the user should wait ([0, \infty]). Any negative values that are returned are set to zero (the bot can't start talking in the past).
    
    A probability of zero represents very high confidence that the caller has stopped speaking, and would like the bot to speak to them. A probability of one represents very high confidence that the caller is still speaking.
    
    Under the hood, this is parsed into a mathjs expression. Whatever you use to write your expression needs to be valid with respect to mathjs
